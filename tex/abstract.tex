Q & A platforms, or question-and-answer platforms, are very popular applications today that allow your users to share
 Knowledge itself through questions and answers. These platforms serve as an online source for users to find
 Quick and efficient objective answers to your questions. Many such applications have come up with their content focused
 on programming.Answered questions and sample codes help programmers to solve problems and obstacles in the day to day developer.

Design Patterns are general solutions applied to object-oriented programming that address recurring problems
 In a given context in software design. A Design Pattern is not a code ready to take advantage of an application but a template
 To solve a problem being solutions that have already been used and tested during the time that gives us confidence in its effectiveness.
 The use of these Patterns bring many benefits to software design, such as facilitating maintenance, improving documentation, making
 software reusable among others. The big problem with using Design Patterns is that most of the time it is necessary to be an experienced developer for Application of a given standard.

Aiming at the popularity and efficiency of Social Question and Answer Platforms in assisting programmers with their doubts and difficulties in using
 Desgin Patterns by programmers, we propose the creation of a application for smartphone, in the model of Q\&  Platforms, 
The e-DesignPatterns. An application to help and accelerate the learning process to use Design Patterns using strategies and features of these platforms to create a successful application.
